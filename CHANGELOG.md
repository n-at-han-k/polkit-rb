## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- `Polkit`, defined from the `Polkit-1.0` GObject Introspection typelib at
  require time, giving asking whether an unprivileged process may do a privileged thing. `Polkit::Loader` is a
  `GObjectIntrospection::Loader` subclass, so the binding is the whole
  namespace rather than a hand-written subset, and it does not drift as the
  library gains API.
- A dev shell (`flake.nix`) that pins the library and glib from one nixpkgs and
  puts their typelibs on `GI_TYPELIB_PATH`, and CI that runs the suite inside
  it, because the environment is the hard part of an introspection binding.

### Changed

- The binding no longer goes through Rust. Earlier revisions wrapped a
  gir-generated crate with magnus, which meant an `ext/` directory, a Cargo
  workspace, system libraries at build time and a nine-platform cross-compile
  matrix, to expose the handful of functions someone had written by hand. The
  typelib loader replaces all of it with about twenty lines of Ruby.
- The gem is pure Ruby and declares no extensions. Installing it still
  compiles C, because `glib2` and `gobject-introspection` are native
  extensions built against glib — but this gem adds no build step of its own,
  and those two are what every ruby-gnome application already has via `gtk4`.
- `bin/release-gem` releases one gem. It was built for the Rust model, where a
  release meant a source gem plus one precompiled gem per platform downloaded
  from the Cross Compile workflow; that workflow is gone and there are no
  platform gems, so left alone it aborted before doing anything.

### Removed

- `ext/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, the cross-compile workflow, and the
  `rb_sys` and `rake-compiler` dependencies.
- `bin/release-gem`. It existed because releasing a Rust gem meant publishing a
  source gem plus one precompiled gem per platform, downloaded from the Cross
  Compile workflow's artifacts. There is nothing to compile here, so there is
  one gem and one push, which is exactly what `gem kit release` does. The
  script added only a check that the local version was ahead of RubyGems, and
  `gem push` already refuses a version that has been pushed.
