  # The loader. This is the whole binding: GObjectIntrospection::Loader reads
  # the typelib and defines the Polkit namespace from it. glib2 comes along as
  # its dependency and is what GLib::Log and the GObject base classes are.
  #
  # Note this does mean installing compiles C: glib2 and gobject-introspection
  # are native extensions built against glib, so a compiler and glib headers
  # are needed. This gem adds no build step of its own, and those two are what
  # every ruby-gnome application already has, since gtk4 depends on them.
  #
  # The C library itself is NOT a gem dependency and cannot be: its typelib
  # belongs to the distribution. See the README.
