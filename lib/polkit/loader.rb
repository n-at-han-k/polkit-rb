module Polkit
  # Defines everything in the Polkit namespace from `Polkit-1.0.typelib`.

  # Modelled on ruby-gnome's own loaders -- see
  # gtksourceview5/lib/gtksourceview5/loader.rb for one that has to call the
  # library's init function first, and libsecret/lib/libsecret/loader.rb for
  # one that does not.
  #
  # The version string is the typelib's rather than the library's release
  # number, and the two often differ: this one is "1.0", from
  # `Polkit-1.0.typelib`.

      # for exactly that purpose.
